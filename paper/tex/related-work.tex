\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}

We categorise related work into four areas: empirical analysis of
smart contract composition and code reuse, the automatic detection of
tokens, graph analysis of blockchains and token systems, and wrapped
tokens.

Software composition is a hard problem~\cite{garlan-et-al-94}.  Smart
contracts sidestep the low-level problems of interoperability by using
a shared execution environment (i.e., a virtual machine) and
\textit{de facto} standards (e.g., ERCs), and the high-level problems
of architectural mismatch by taking a bottom-up approach to
composition.  He et al.~\cite{he-et-al-20} perform a large-scale
analysis of \num{10} million Ethereum smart contracts deployed between
July 2015 and December 2018.  They show that less than \num{1}\% of
the contracts are distinct, and more than \num{63}\% of those are
similar to at least one other contract.  The results have been
replicated~(\hspace{1sp}\cite{kondo-et-al-20,chen-et-al-21,khan-et-al-22}).

Fr\"owis et al.~\cite{frowis-et-al-19} use symbolic execution to
automatically detect smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that
implement token functionality.  Di Angelo and
Salzer~\cite{di-angelo-salzer-21} reconstruct contract interfaces and
events from EVM bytecode.  They used transaction data to identify
token contracts that comply with ERC standards and token contracts
that do not.  Oliveira et al.~\cite{oliveira-et-al-18} propose a
taxonomy for classifying tokens and they propose a decision tree to
guide the token design process.

Kitzler et al.~\cite{kitzler-et-al-21} analyse activity relating to
\textit{decentralised finance} (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain.
They construct and topologically analyse two graphs: the
\textit{contract account graph} where the vertices are contract
accounts and the edges are transactions between those accounts, and
the \textit{protocol graph} where the vertices are protocols and the
edges are transactions between those protocols.  They show that
community finding algorithms identify communities in the contract
account graph, but the communities do not correspond to protocols.
There are several network analyses of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum
blockchain that quantify their age, economic value, activity volume,
etc.~(\hspace{1sp}\cite{somin-et-al-18,victor-luders-19})

Caldarelli~\cite{caldarelli-21} describes wrapped tokens and their
ability to represent real-world assets and to bridge tokens across
blockchains.  The WBTC whitepaper~\cite{kyber-et-al-xx} sets out a
general framework for tokenising assets on a blockchain.  Santoro et
al.~\cite{santoro-et-al-22} propose a standard interface for
\textit{vaults} for ERC-20 tokens.  A vault can store a single
\textit{asset} or underlying token.  Users can \textit{deposit} or
\textit{withdraw} the asset.  In return, they receive \textit{shares}
in the form of another ERC-20 token.  Lloyd et
al.~\cite{lloyd-et-al-23} analysed the emergent outcomes of
\textit{vote-escrowed tokens} (veTokens) where a token is locked for a
fixed period in exchange for voting rights.

We use common terminology from graph theory through-out the paper.
