\section{Token Composition}\label{sec:token-composition}

Tokens are the primary building block of blockchain-based protocols
and applications~\cite{voshmgir-20}.  Token composition is a technique
where one or more tokens can be combined to create new tokens.  The
entitlements of the input tokens are appropriated by the new token.
This allows for the creation of complex tokens by chaining together
simpler tokens.
