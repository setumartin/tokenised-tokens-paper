\section{Token Composition}\label{sec:token-composition}

Token composition is a technique where one or more tokens can be
combined to create new tokens.  The entitlements of the input tokens
are appropriated by the new token.  This allows for the creation of
complex tokens by chaining together simpler tokens.
